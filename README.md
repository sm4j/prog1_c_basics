# Programming Coursework Repository

This repository showcases the foundation of my programming knowledge through various C projects. While not flashy, it reflects my commitment to organization, keeping all coursework from my degree program transparent and well-maintained. Note that there is no version history, as these are coursework submissions from Fall 2023.

## Programs

### Program 1: Hello World
A basic "Hello World" program, included for repository completeness.

### Program 2: Simple Interactive Application
This C program creates a simple interactive application that engages users through a series of inputs and calculations. It showcases fundamental C programming concepts, including variable declaration, user input, character manipulation, and arithmetic operations.

### Program 3: Functions for User Input and Calculations
Program 3 illustrates the use of functions to manage user input and perform calculations. It features a greeting function that introduces the program's purpose and includes character manipulation and conversion functions for length measurements. This program effectively showcases principles of function definition, data types, and arithmetic operations.

### Program 4: Food Purchasing Simulation
This C program simulates a food purchasing experience, allowing users to select items from a menu and specify quantities. It manages the user's account balance, calculates the total cost of selected items, and ensures sufficient funds are available before completing the purchase. Key programming concepts demonstrated include user interaction, input validation, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Program 5: Student Grade Calculator
This C program facilitates the calculation of assessment grades for students by allowing users to input a student ID and multiple assessment grades. It computes total points, the number of assessments, and the average grade, while providing options to reset for a new student or quit the program. The program emphasizes user interaction and error handling to ensure valid input.

### Program 6: Food Ordering System with Persistent Balance Management
This C application implements a food ordering system with a main menu offering options to add items, reset the order, check out, or quit. It retrieves the user's balance from a text file and updates it after each checkout, ensuring the new balance is saved. Users can add multiple items to their order until they choose to reset or proceed to checkout. After completing a purchase, they can start a new order or exit the program, with a farewell message displayed upon quitting. The program effectively demonstrates file handling, user input, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Program 7: Jumbled Word Game
This C program implements a Jumbled Word Game where players have three attempts to guess a jumbled word displayed along with its length. The game retrieves pairs of jumbled and solution words from a text file. If the player fails to guess the word on their first attempt, the first and last letters of the solution are revealed. After either guessing correctly or exhausting their attempts, the solution is displayed, and players can decide whether to play again. The game effectively demonstrates file handling, string manipulation, and user interaction.

### Program 8: Cat Struct Management System
This program demonstrates the use of user-defined structures in C by managing information about cats. It employs functions to fill individual cat data and arrays of cats, showcasing techniques for both value and pointer manipulation. Key programming skills highlighted include defining and using structs, function prototypes, and managing arrays, reinforcing concepts of memory management and data encapsulation. The code emphasizes good practices in data input and output through user interaction.

### Program 9: Student Grade Management System Using Structs in C
This program utilizes user-defined structures to manage student information, allowing users to view, add, and calculate assessment averages for students. It incorporates a range of functions to initialize student data, display lists, and update scores, reinforcing concepts of modular programming and data encapsulation. Key skills demonstrated include managing arrays of structs, user interaction through menus, and performing calculations based on dynamic input. The program exemplifies effective data handling and user experience in a console application.
